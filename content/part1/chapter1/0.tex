In this chapter, we will discuss the basic steps of setting up the environment for future experiments with Clang . The setup is appropriate for Unix-based systems such as Linux and Mac OS (Darwin). In addition, you will get important information on how to download, configure, and build the LLVM source code. We will continue with a short session that explains how to build and use the LLVM debugger (LLDB ), which will be used as the primary tool for code investigation throughout the book. Finally, we will finish with a simple Clang tool that can check C/C++ files for compilation errors. We will use LLDB for a simple debug session for the created tool and clang internal. We will cover the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Prerequisites

\item
Getting to know LLVM

\item
Source code compilation

\item
How to create a custom Clang tool
\end{itemize}
