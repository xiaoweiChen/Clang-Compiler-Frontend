In this chapter, we have acquired a basic understanding of compiler architecture and delved into the various stages of the compilation process, with a focus on the Clang driver. We have explored the internals of the Clang frontend, studying the Preprocessor that transforms a program into a set of tokens, and the Parser, which interacts with a component called 'Sema'. Together, these elements perform syntax and semantic analysis.

The upcoming chapter will center on the Clang Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)â€”the primary data structure employed in various Clang tools. We will discuss its construction and the methods for traversing it.
