In this chapter, we became familiar with the basic classes from the LLVM ADT library. We gained knowledge of Clang diagnostics and the test frameworks used in LLVM for various types of testing. Using this knowledge, we created a simple Clang plugin that detects complex classes and issues a warning about their complexity.

The chapter concludes the first part of the book, where we gained basic knowledge of the Clang compiler frontend. We are now prepared to explore various tools built on the foundation of Clang libraries. We will begin with Clang-Tidy, a powerful linter framework used to detect various issues in C++ code.
