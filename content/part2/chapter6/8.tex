In this chapter, we investigated Clangâ€™s CFG, a powerful data structure that represents the symbolic execution of a program. We created a simple Clang-Tidy check using a CFG to calculate cyclomatic complexity, a metric useful for estimating code complexity. Additionally, we explored the details of CFG creation and the formation of its basic internal structures. We discussed some tools developed with CFGs, which are useful for detecting lifetime issues, thread safety, and uninitialized variables. We also briefly described the limitations of CFGs and how other tools can address these limitations.

The next chapter will cover refactoring tools. These tools can perform complex code modifications using the AST provided by the Clang compiler.
