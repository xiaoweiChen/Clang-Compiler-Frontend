In this chapter, we investigated the different options provided by Clang for code modifications. We created a specialized Clang Tool that renames a method in a test class. We also rewrote the tool using Clang-Tidy and explored how custom AST matchers can be created. Furthermore, we delved into a variety of different classes provided by Clang for code modifications. One of these classes, clang::FixItHint, is integrated with the Clang diagnostics subsystem and provides a powerful tool for code modification within Clang, as well as in different tools created with Clang. We concluded with Clang-Format, the only tool in the book that does not use the AST but instead utilizes the Clang Lexer to perform code formatting. The next chapter will focus on the integration of different Clang Tools within IDEs.
