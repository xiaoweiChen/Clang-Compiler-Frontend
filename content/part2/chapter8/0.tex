This chapter is about the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and how you can utilize it to enhance your Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Our primary IDE of choice is Visual Studio Code (VS Code). LLVM has its own implementation of LSP known as Clangd. We will begin by describing LSP and exploring how Clangd leverages it to extend the capabilities provided by the IDE. Finally, we will conclude with examples of how various Clang tools, such as Clang-Tidy and Clang-Format, can be seamlessly integrated into the IDE through Clangd.

We will cover the following topics in this chapter:

\begin{itemize}
\item
What is Language Server Protocol (LSP) and how does it improve an IDE's capabilities?

\item
How VS Code and Clangd (the Clang LSP server) can be installed

\item
How LSP is used to connect VS Code and Clangd, through an example

\item
How Clangd is integrated with other Clang tools

\item
Why performance matters for Clangd and what optimizations were made to make Clangd fast
\end{itemize}
