In this chapter, we acquired knowledge of LSP, a protocol used to provide developer tools integration with IDEs. We explored Clangd, an LSP server that is part of LLVM and can be considered as a prime example of how it integrates various tools discussed in the book. Clangd utilizes the Clang frontend to display compilation errors and leverages the AST as a fundamental data structure that provides information for navigation requests, such as go-to definition requests. Additionally, Clangd is seamlessly integrated with other tools covered in previous chapters, such as Clang-Tidy and Clang-Format. This integration showcases the significant benefits of the LLVM/Clang module structure.
