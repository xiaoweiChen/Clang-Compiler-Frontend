You can find some info about different Clang tools here. We will start with linters that are based on Clang-Tidy, continue with some advanced code analysis techniques (CFG and live time analysis). The next chapter will be about different refactoring tools such as Clang-Format. The last chapter will be about IDE support. We are going to investigate how Visual Studio Code can be extended with language server provided by LLVM (Clangd).

This part has the following chapters:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Chapter 5, Clang-Tidy Linter Framework

\item
Chapter 6, Advanced Code Analysis

\item
Chapter 7, Refactoring Tools

\item
