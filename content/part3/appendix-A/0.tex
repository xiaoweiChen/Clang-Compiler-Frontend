The test examples considered in the book do not require special compilation flags and typically can be compiled without any flags. However, this is not the scenario if you want to employ the material on a real project, such as running a lint check on your code base. In that situation, you will need to furnish special compilation flags for each file to be processed. Clang offers various methods for supplying these flags. We will explore in detail the JSON Compilation Database, which is one of the primary tools for delivering compilation flags to Clang tools such as Clang-Tidy and Clangd.
