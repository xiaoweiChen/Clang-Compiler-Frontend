The Clang compiler is a very complex topic, and some details were omitted in the primary chapters of the book. The appendix covers some important aspects of Clang and Clang Tools that might be valuable if you are starting to apply this knowledge to complex projects containing many files and intricate build rules.

We will begin by discussing how Clang Tools can be integrated into a large project that uses complex compilation flags. LLVM serves as one of the examples of such projects.

Another important aspect is performance in complex C++ projects. Clang offers techniques that can be used to improve build speed for such projects, and we will also explore these features.

This part has the following chapters:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Chapter 9, Compilation Database

\item
Chapter 10, Build Speed Optimizations
\end{itemize}
